## About me
<img src="images/xiaolongbao.jpeg" alt="Xiaolongbao" align="right" width="200px" style="border-radius: 15px;">

I’m __Xiaoyu Wang (王小禹)__, from Shanghai, China, a city known for its vibrant blend of tradition and modernity, where historic landmarks like the Bund meet towering skyscrapers that define the skyline. Shanghai is also famed for its role as a global financial hub and its unique culinary scene, including iconic dishes such as Xiaolongbao(soup dumplings).



I am currently a 3rd-year Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at Florida State University. My research focuses on Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models.

I work under the supervision of Dr. Zhe He in the eHealth Lab in the School of Information (iSchool), College of Communication & Information at FSU. Currently, I am doing three projects. One is to make annotations on Electronic Health Records(EHRs) in order to extract Social Determinants of Health from patients. The second is to build machine learning models on HIV data.

I am also a proud member of the [LabGenie Project](https://sites.google.com/view/labgeniefsu/), where I am working on building Lab-ai, which will help patients to understand their lab test result better.
